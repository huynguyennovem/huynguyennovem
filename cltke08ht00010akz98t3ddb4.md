Welcome back to the second part of the series on compiling the Flutter engine locally. In the first article, we learned how to build the engine using the latest version. Now, we'll explore how to build the engine on a specific version and apply a fixed commit to it for your desired engine version.

The example I will use in this article: [https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/130476](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/130476)

## Issue analysis

* The bug doesn't occur on stable `3.10.6` but on master `3.13.0-3.0.pre.21` (as OP reported). The current master is `3.13.0-7.0.pre.57` (the released version I have on my machine now) and the issue is already fixed on this version.
    
* The bug is fixed by [https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/43695](https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/43695). The commit is [https://github.com/flutter/engine/commit/bf6d4bfe27cca6e6189382d17e5d371162492a27](https://github.com/flutter/engine/commit/bf6d4bfe27cca6e6189382d17e5d371162492a27):
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710006843724/6ef7a8bc-927e-4f1a-97ab-8640af201da9.png align="center")
    
* The fix is only available on these master versions: `3.13.0-7.0.pre`, `3.13.0-6.0.pre`, `3.13.0-5.0.pre`
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710006875089/33c18764-98c8-4416-b48c-d1e20a5b6fe1.png align="center")

* The bug appears on master version `3.13.0-3.0.pre.21` which has engine revision `1b1ccdd1f5` (you can check this from `flutter doctor -v` of OP report)
    

ðŸ‘‰ The final goal is building an engine version which is started from revision of Flutter master `3.13.0-3.0.pre.21`, and then cherry-pick the fix commit above. To make it easier to imagine:

> engine output X = 3.13.0-3.0.pre.21 + bf6d4bfe27cca6e6189382d17e5d371162492a27).

Let's go through the steps below section by section. The first section is intended to build the engine at a specific released version. But if you only need to build engine with fix (the final goal), you can skip the 1st section and go to 2nd section.

## Build engine

### 1\. Build engine on a specific released version

Currently, my local engine repository (`src/flutter`) is on the latest version `3.13.0-7.0.pre.57`. But I want to build engine at version `3.13.0-3.0.pre.21`. The bug can be reproducible on this version, so I can verify the result by checking the bug after building process finished.

* Step 1: cd to main engine directory (`src/flutter` is actually engine repository, not `engine` directory outside)
    

```bash
âžœ  engine cd src/flutter/
```

* Step 2: Checkout new branch from that revision, named it `master-313-030-pre21-build-engine`:
    

```bash
 âžœ  flutter git:(main) git checkout -b master-313-030-pre21-build-engine 1b1ccdd1f5 
Updating files: 100% (1799/1799), done.
Switched to a new branch 'master-313-030-pre21-build-engine'
```

* Step 3: Start building it as previous guide (without needing to rebuild files for device-side and host-side executables)
    

```bash
âžœ  engine gclient sync
Updating depot_tools...
Syncing projects: 100% (141/141), done.

Nice, I can see the bug now with the wrong UI on iPhone and there are many logs `ImpellerValidationBreak` in the output console, it means the engine is built at released version `3.13.0-3.0.pre.21` successfully. You can then use this build to test or validate any issues you encountered as well.

### 2\. Build engine with a fix

Now, let's say you encounter a specific bug that has already been fixed in the Flutter engine's latest version, but you don't want to upgrade the SDK entirely. You can cherry-pick the fix into your local engine build to address the issue. Here's how:

* Step 1: Let's make sure the previous branch is clean with no local change. Otherwise, let's delete the current local branch created above `master-313-030-pre21-build-engine` and recreate it. (Skip this step if you haven't tried the 1st section yet)
    

```bash
âžœ  flutter git:(main) git branch -d master-313-030-pre21-build-engine
Deleted branch master-313-030-pre21-build-engine (was 1b1ccdd1f5).

âžœ  flutter git:(1b1ccdd1f5) git checkout -b master-313-030-pre21-build-engine 1b1ccdd1f5
Switched to a new branch 'master-313-030-pre21-build-engine'
```

* Step 2: pick the commit that fixed the bug. There might be some conflicts, you should solve them and commit changes to your created branch (`master-313-030-pre21-build-engine`). The good commit can be found in section `First analysis` above.
    

```bash
âžœ  flutter git:(master-313-030-pre21-build-engine) âœ— git cherry-pick bf6d4bfe27cca6e6189382d17e5d371162492a27
error: could not apply bf6d4bfe27... [Impeller] Fix text scaling issues again, this time with perspective when a save layer is involved (#43695)
hint: after resolving the conflicts, mark the corrected paths
hint: with 'git add <paths>' or 'git rm <paths>'
hint: and commit the result with 'git commit'

âžœ  flutter git:(master-313-030-pre21-build-engine) âœ— git add .

âžœ  flutter git:(master-313-030-pre21-build-engine) âœ— git commit -m "pick fix for issue 130476"

```

* Step 3: Now you have the engine source as expected, start building engine as the previous guide (same as the previous section, no need to rebuild files for device-side and host-side executables)
    

```bash
âžœ  flutter git:(master-313-030-pre21-build-engine) cd ../..

âžœ  engine gclient sync

Hook 'python3 src/flutter/tools/pub_get_offline.py' took 11.47 secs

âžœ  engine cd src

```

* Step 4: Run the new engine build on sample code to verify if the bug has been fixed:
    

```bash
âžœ  new_3106 flutterm run --local-engine=ios_debug_unopt --local-engine-host=host_debug_unopt --local-engine-src-path=/Users/huynq/Documents/GitHub/engine/src

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've now mastered the art of compiling the Flutter engine locally on specific versions and applying fixes. Armed with this knowledge, you can confidently tackle various development scenarios and verify bug fixes without the need to upgrade to the latest SDK version.

Now, armed with your newfound expertise, go forth and build amazing Flutter applications with confidence, knowing you have the power to control and customize the engine to suit your needs.

Happy Fluttering!
